# BitRun
Final group project in our 282 class; basically we had to create a game using ONLY the unix libraries instead of the traditional C libraries. We made a game that's similar to temple run but with 10 lanes. Avoid as many "bits" as you can while trying to collect "$" as you go. The objects will eventually come at you so fast, you will be forced to lose.
